# Project Journal
Hello hello! I'm going to document my progress with this website here. </br>

The smallest of changes takes so long when you know basically nothing and are easily distracted. The font change to serif took like an hour and a half for this reason. I am okay with this. </br>

I bought my domain earlier today!</br>
Or at least, the rights to it for a year, for the hefty price of 2 dollars! I know I have done literally nothing with it at the moment, but it still feels very exciting. lisas.site is mine! Other potential candidates were lisasweb.site (not as cool because it's not as short smh), lisas.online (cool but like a thousand dollars), lisas.computer (still cool but still expensive), and of course, lisa.wtf, lisas.fun, and lisas.cool (so true). In the end though, I settled on lisas.site. Now to connect it to my github page, which at the moment says Hello World... hopefully I'll come back to this in 20 minutes and be able to give the update that I have done this successfully. If not, I'll give that update too lol. </br>
I got curious and wanted to check GoDaddy for domain options and learned lisas.website is available for 0.99 on GoDaddy. That's literally half of what I paid for lisas.site on NameCheap!!! I am so sad rn. I'm strongly considering buying the domain as well but that feels like overkill. I've texted my friend for counsel. In the meantime, I will (sadly) go back to the DNS verification stuff. </br>
2:19 am - Successfully verified my domain! Also, I feel placated knowing that Namecheap gives free email forwarding services for email and has WHOIS protection for free. 2:46 am - got sidetracked by tiktok. going to add cname record now!

Long time no see! Really long time actually. </br> 
Summer is dwindling down, so it's time I get to work on this website! I think I have a general idea of what I want it to look like, which will be pretty simple, but we'll see how that turns out and then scale it up later if needed. </br>

Currently working on the favicon! Tmw's work is making multiple pages. 
1:18 am - The favicon looks funky and is too small. I'll fix tmw, signing off for now. </br>
