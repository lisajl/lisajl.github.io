    <h1> about me </h1>
    <p> I'm Lisa. This is my personal website! I just graduated from UIUC with a BS in Computer Science. 
        In my free time, I like to hike and see new places, read, try out new recipes, and video edit. 
        I'm also trying to get better at chess right now because I'm god awful naturally.
        I'm also trying to learn how to skateboard! I still can't ollie. </p>
