    <p> I'm Lisa. This is my personal website! I'm a senior studying computer science at UIUC. I'm a happy citizen of the internet and the wide wide web, but when not coding, I love the great outdoors, I love reading, making and enjoying tasty food, and more!
        I'm trying to learn how to ollie on my skateboard (I don't think I'm jumping enough)
        Shoot me an email at ljleung2@illinois.edu!
